## Overview

* This readme is to give instruction on how to set up and use the Restaurant Reviews App, this is a project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree, it credits contributers, list useful resources and code dependancies.

## Project Instructions

In this project, I needed to convert a static webpage that lacked accessibility and convert it to be a mobile-ready web application. The design has to be responsive and accessible for screen reader use. It also needs a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Run the Application

In order to run the application you need to run it localy:

* Download as .zip file or clone this project:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/benandrewtyler/Restaurant-Reviews-App.git
    ```

* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has the tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

## Credits

We are particularly grateful to the Udacity community behind the creation of the FEND course, their authors and all their contributors for their great work from which this restaurant review app was greatly inspired and without which perhaps i would not be the front end dev I am today.
Hopefully, new features, patches or tests added to this repo might as well be ported/adapted to be contributed and shared back in return.
